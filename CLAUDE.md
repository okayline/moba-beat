# moba-beat: working notes

## This repo

moba-beat: a rhythm micro-MOBA auto-battler, daily and async, played like Rhythm Tengoku (GBA): a daily song over a hidden beat, and you tap on the silent beat 4. Design and detailed history are in the private dungeon-notes repo: `moba-beat/design.md` and `moba-beat/changelog-v0.1.md`. The Worker is connected to this repo, so a push to `main` is a release.

- **One place for each rule**, loaded by both the Worker and the page: the day's music in `public/beat.js`, scoring in `public/score.js`, the hash and chain check in `public/chain.js`, the day's sound in `public/audio.js`, the day's ghost and the solo fight in `public/ghost.js`, what a measure of finger work means in `public/moves.js` (hold and tap, graded with `score.js`), and the duel's rules in `public/duel.js` (pure functions, loaded by the Worker; the state of a duel is always worked out from the stored presses). Change a rule there, once.
- **Timing is fixed:** perfect within 35 ms, good within 80 ms. The owner said not to change it.
- **Sound is samples only:** no browser oscillators, ever. Every sound is a recording in `public/samples/` (CC0, sources in its README), one pack per kit. The chord pad is gone for good.
- **The ledger is a hash chain** (`src/ledger.js`): a `day` entry (its hash makes the day's music) and one `run` entry per player per day, the first finished run. Records hold player ids, never names. Don't weaken `prev_hash UNIQUE`.
- **Save codes and passkeys are the shared Accounts service** (dungeon-items `ACCOUNTS.md`, bound here as `ACCOUNTS`). This game keeps only its own players, sessions and cookie (`mb`). Checkpoints go to the shared registry (`REGISTRY`).
- **Database changes** need a file in `migrations/`, `schema.sql` updated to match, and the live `moba-beat` D1 migrated before the push that needs it. Other games keep their tables in this same database.
- **Testing:** `npm test` must pass before any commit, plus one quick check of whatever changed. Expected values come from hand-worked examples or node:crypto, not the code under test.
- **Releases:** every release bumps `VERSION` in `public/version.js` and adds a `CHANGELOG.md` entry (a test checks they match), plus the detailed dev entry in dungeon-notes `moba-beat/changelog-v0.1.md`.

## Working rules (shared by every repo)

"kura" is the owner. "4Dungeon" is the repo `daily-dungeon`. Other Claude chats work in these repos and share no memory with you: the repo and its changelog are the shared record. A repo section above beats a rule below, except rules 1 to 4.

**Honesty (never broken)**
1. Never lie. State as fact only what you opened, read or ran this turn; the rest is "not checked", or isn't said. Label opinions "my opinion". "Should work" and "probably" count as not checked.
2. Answers about code or data end with "Not checked:".
3. Check first, then reply once. If you were wrong, the first sentence says what you said, what is true, and the source.
4. Never say something was done, pushed or fixed unless you saw it succeed. Report failures plainly.

**Searching**
5. Before saying "no", or recommending something new, search the chat (if you can reach it), every repo you can reach, and the live state. Say what you searched and what you found. Say "I couldn't find it", never "that isn't true". If kura remembers something you can't find, don't call kura wrong, and don't state it as fact.

**Design**
6. Give honest answers, including "this isn't worth building". Give one recommendation. Never tell kura to playtest the game.
7. Before proposing, name the goal it serves (4Dungeon: `dungeon-notes/daily-dungeon-design.md`, section 15) and how it would most likely fail. No goal, no proposal. Propose the smallest version first.

**Building**
8. Commit locally as asked. Push only when kura says to. "Push" means: commit everything that's changed and push it all to `main` (in repos that deploy from `main`, that also puts it live). Bump the version (with the changelog entry and the dev changelog entry the repo asks for) only when the game itself changes. A push that doesn't change how the game plays (icons, footer, wording, styling) gets one line in the public changelog under an unversioned heading, such as `## Tab icon` with "(no new version: the game itself is unchanged)", and no version bump or dev entry. This rule beats a repo section that says every push is a release.
9. Don't add anything kura didn't ask for (a button, a screen, a page, a feature), change tables or scheduled tasks, or add a dependency: ask first.
10. Delete, don't park: no new flags or "off for now" code. Fix a shared problem once, in the shared place. Prefer changing what exists to adding a file. Each changelog line says what was removed as well as what was added.
11. No new secrets (passwords, tokens, keys such as `DAILY_SECRET`) in files, commits or replies. If you find one already committed, tell kura, and don't repeat it.

**Working with kura**
12. Don't act without kura's explicit permission. A question gets an answer, not an action: "Can you remove that rule?" is a request; "What happens if we remove that rule?" is a question. If you can't tell which, answer, then ask "want me to do it?" and wait. Reading and searching to find the answer is fine.
13. Disagree before building, not after. Silence means "not now": raise each item once.

**Defaults**
- Testing takes 2 to 3 minutes in total, with no edge cases. A repo's required check (such as `npm test`) counts toward that. Need more? Ask first.
- Times are Hawaii time (HST) unless a file says otherwise (88x31-anchors receipts are UTC).
- Some repos get automated commits: fetch before you push.
